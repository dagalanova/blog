## 14 tips for making a presentation you're not ashamed of
A good presentation starts with questions to yourself. You can do the most important part in notepad without even turning on your computer. First, you choose a topic, define a goal, distribute the arguments in the right order. And only now you can open the program and look for pictures for the presentation.

1. Formulate a topic
It is difficult to listen to an interlocutor who jumps from one to another, so the presentation should have only one topic. Otherwise, it will be a long story about nothing. The topic should be narrow enough to offer a solution to the problem at the end. Narrow the topic down until the presentation can be summed up in ten short paragraphs.

Determining a good topic is easy - it itself suggests the structure of the speech.
Broad topic, thought jumps

2. Define a goal
A good presentation changes the existing picture of the world.

A good presentation goal starts with the question: what do I want to change in the behavior of the listeners.

3. Think of a script
The purpose of the presentation is what you want to change in the listener's head, and the script is how you will arrive at those changes.

4. Show examples
Less theory, more life. Show how your product works and how people use it. See how they do it on Kickstarter.
5. Alternate slides
Presentation is like text. If the text consists of sentences of the same length and the same type, it will be boring to read. There is no rhythm. Therefore, alternate text slides and slides with images, add graphics. Sometimes you can joke.

6. Lyrics are shorter
One slide, one thought. This slide is easy to read and remember. If you are speaking in public, he will keep the attention of the audience.
